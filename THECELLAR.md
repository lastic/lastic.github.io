## Why does one start a Bulletin Board System in 2024 ?

I grew up with a PC and its demoscene and the BBS culture
always wanting an Atari ST.

When I read a Multi-User BBS existed on the Atari ST I had found a new project
to dive into.

It has taught me a lot of Python, UNIX tools and patience since starting to work
on it in February and have the base system running in March 2024.

## So what is it and how can I access it ?

telnet thecell.ar port 1040

The BBS runs on an Atari MegaSTe 
!(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Atari-mega-ste.jpg)

connected to the internet via a Lantronix Serial-to-Ethernet device.

The Lantronix enable the STe to accept an telnet session and it will translate this to
AT commands upon which the BBS will accept the call and launch the logon procedure.

It currently only allows 1 user at a time, if you cannot connect, please try again later.

It runs in 80 colums by 25 rows and the menus have been optimised for this.

The menus are ASCII, ANSI (16 colors) or VT52 (Atari ST 4 colors) 

It is best enjoyed with 

PC Syncterm     RAW,19200 Baud,8N1 (ASCII/ANSI)

or Atari ST ANSI capable Terminal      
   ANSIterm  19200 BAUD,8N1

or Atari ST VT52 capable Terminal
   TAZ,STalker,Flash , 19200 BAUD,8N1
   for 4 colors 

You can also use your browser to access it via [FTELNET](http://www.sfhqbbs.org/ftelnet.php?bbsid=36)
