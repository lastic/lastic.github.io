When we were at SillyVenture 2024 beginning of December in Gdanks,Poland, I told our president of ABBUC why don't we have sweaters with the ABBUC logo.
I was wearing my ABBUC tshirts but due to the cold temperatures they were hidden underneath my non-ABBUC sweater.

Carsten, the ABBUC president, came back to me the next day with a fantastic idea.

Since I visit (or do plan to visit) a lot of Atari/Demoscene events, he asked me to list all the events I might go or are related to the Atari scene.

Beginning of this year he came back to me with a mockup of the design and today I received my Tour sweater for 2025 which I will be proud to wear.
