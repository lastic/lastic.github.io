I tend to like old computers with tapedrives and so I stumbled upon the Amstrad CPC
and discovered its demoscene.

Which led me to discovering these 2 websites.

So when I saw there was a book on the Amstrad Demoscene written by Hicks/Vanity,
I contacted him if I could buy one.

And I also went ahead and bought the Annual 64NOPS magazine.

Both arrived in Belgium and wow the quality and presentation of them is excellent.

Memory Full is a hardcover book containing 180 pages.

The 64NOPS magazines edition 1 (2023) and 2 (2024) have a sturdy glossy cover.

Now only issue is where to find space in my book closet after reading them.

Since I have a 6 hour train trip planned to Givry-En-Argonne when going to the ShadowParty,
I will read both the book and magazines on the train.

So expect a review beginning of July together with my ShadowParty report.

Last but not least, thanks David aka Hicks/Vanity for the personal 
handwritten note in the book, highly appreciated.
