Just a short blog entry for a very interesting Youtube channel I just recently discovered.

psenough , a gentle Portugese man who presents a weekly report of the global Demoscene.

I really enjoyed it and like the short format of it,in 20 to 30 minutes
there is nice presentation of all demoscene related events and releases.

Have a look yourself and if you like it , consider subscribing to support his channel
