Since I take my 520ST with me to Atari meetings, I really missed having a floppy drive with me.
The 520ST does not have an internal floppy but the positive of this is that the 520ST dimensions are easier to fit into a backpack.



Another issue is that the floppy port sits right next to the ACSI port on the 520ST so there is not a lot of room
for a floppy connector.

But then I stumbled upon this creation by a Dutch retrocomputing seller which I already had bought several items from.

This version will only work with the older type GOTEK but luckily I only have old stuff lying around at home :)

For another project I had bought an ABS case with closely resembles the grey ST colour.

So the idea was born to create a mini-GOTEK.

Now to adapt the case to fit the GOTEK PCB and the adapter.

After 2 hours of Dremel cutouts and filing this is the result.

Then after receiving the next parts , a 90 Degrees Mini-B USB Cable and  Piezo Buzzer, the final steps of the 
build could be completed.

The original green LED I had fitted was a bit dull so I added a brighter red LED and made a hole for it in the
case so it would be more visible.

And the final result , here is a demonstration video of
