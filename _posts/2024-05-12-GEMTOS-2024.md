When I planned my vacations this January, I noticed two consecutive bank holidays in May.  
And two events were happening in May , GEMTOS in France and Outline in The Netherlands.  
https://gemtos.forumactif.com/f1-gemtos-convention

A quick Google Maps search and NMBS International (Belgium trains) route planning showed  
me that a 5 hour trip and 4 trains would get me to Saint-Juste-en-Chaussee in France.  



Disaster struck when I had failed to notice that you had to make a reservation upfront to  
be able to attend. Since the deadline had passed, I emailed the organiser "Manu" and about
a week later he got back to me that a spot had become available.  Ouf  

So on Saturday the 4th of May at 06:00 AM my trip to France started.

Saint-Juste-en-Chaussee is situated in the Oisy region , about 100 km above Paris and 50 km
below Amiens.  
It is lovely region (a picture I took on the last stop before arriving at GEMTOS - Longeau )

and around 11:00 AM I arrived in this nice little village.

So I walked to my AirBNB booking which was convienently about a 5 minute walk from the train station, met up with the owner, had a lovely chat, took the keys and off I went to
the "Salles Des Fetes" where GEMTOS is hosted.

Walking up the stairs to the 1st floor, I was greeted at the entrance by Manu and his wife SÃ©verine who handed me my enveloppe containing food vouchers/questionaire and a pin-up badge. 

I had made a reservation including food on Saturday and Sunday and as such I quickly setup 
my Atari 520ST

and then it was 12:00 so I went and picked up my sandwich with pate and sat down with the other participants for lunch.

Over the 2 days there was a Midi-Maze contest with 4 Atari ST/TT's

and a 2 computer Lotus Turbo contest.

Also unknown to those participating , there was a suprise game-contest , getting the highest score on Galaxian on the Atari 7800.

Later Saturday afternoon LordKraken (who attented all the way from Sweden) and Fadest (Yastuna Games) showed their GEMTOS exclusive new Lynx game, I have a picture of it and a sticker but I will not reveal it, I didn't get a chance to glimpse at the game even with the amount of people gathered around the developers.

I had a nice chat with Ninjabba who was a Dutch guy developing for Yastuna Games on the Lynx and Jaguar.

Indeed 2 Dutch people and a Belgian couple.
Georges aka Shadow272 , a nice fellow Belgian from Charleroi , was present and we had quite an interesting chat.
He showed me his extensive Atari collection at home and invited me to Atari Nancy Days , another
convention in France.
Some of his boxes were displayed on stage.

I was so happy to finally meet another Belgian Atari interested person, thanks for the invite Georges, and we will keep in touch !

A lot of Jaguar and Lynx related things at GEMTOS.

A lot of people visited my 520ST , we talked about Wimodems, Telnet BBSes, the RTS keyboard upgrade
that my 520ST has , the SideCart , my mini-Gotek and well nostalgia in General.

Everybody was super friendly and stoked at the event, I got invited to another event in France, ShadowParty.
Somebody ( I forgot your pseudo) complimented me on my UltraSyd t-shirt and shared his memories
of UltraSyd and told me/invited me to go to Revision in Germany (next year since it has already passed).

Some people were busy programming in GFA , some people were busy on their laptops I guess in Assembler/C.

The person next to me was upgrading his Falcon and helping another fellow Frenchmen upgrade his Falcon too.

Somebody was helping installing an RTC kit for ST's.

One person had a whole soldering/desoldering station with him and was repairing machines.

There was a lot of systems around, not only Ataris.

DMA-SC has a really nice yellow STe.

Time went by so fast , at 19:30 we had dinner (pizza).  
The winners of the tombola were decided by an innocent hand.  
Around 21:00 2 French guys graced the stage with their amazing music setup.

![THEOTHERDAYS](/assets/images/THEOTHERDAY.JPG)

I had seen them busy earlier connecting everything and setting it up.  
They theotherdays.net basically have FPGA versions of most soundchips and a
live composing/mixing set of various known songs.  

![MOVIE](/assets/images/THEOTHERDAY.MOV)

After this really nice concert , there was a 16 person game of TRON on the new Atari VCS.
Impressive to say the least.

![VCSTRON16](/assets/images/VCSTRON16.JPG)

All looked fine at the start but then
![TRONSTART](/assets/images/TRONSTART.JPG)

in just 2 seconds everybody collapsed

![TRONKABOOM](/assets/images/TRONKABOOM.JPG)

It took some people several rounds to get the hang of this
