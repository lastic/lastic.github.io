After a busy month of August finally the blog post to
the newest family member in my retro-collection.

The MegaST2

<!--more-->

My 520ST+ (1MB RAM) was residing on my desk as my goto-ST but the mechanical keyboard (which I already owned) and form-factor lured me to search for an MegaST
to reside next to the BBS-running-MegaSTe.

I found an working MegaST2 on eBAY Germany, which the seller was willing to ship to Belgium.

It is in a nice cosmetic condition and it was still factory sealed.

Like all my machines I try not to tear up the seal :)

Helas TOS 1.02 in 2 ROM sockets but at least German TOS
pairs nice with my QWERTZ keyboard.

And yes, in Belgium we have AZERTY but I can type on 
QWERTY and QWERTZ also.

I already owned a MegaST keyboard which I might still use
for another project (MiSTery-TangNano) but for the time
being it will serve the MegaST2.

I was sold as broken on Kleinanzeigen Germany but the cracks in the top case aren´t too bad actually.

For those noticing the missing/wrong keys, Jurgen TF_HH has been so kind in the meanwhile to send me those so all
keys are present now except I have an E key instead of Esc , well it is pretty close isn´t it :D

And on Allegra Poland I found a seller who sells customs
2 ROM chips for TOS, so for less than the price of having
to find and buy the EPROMS,buy an EPROM burner and do all the wire-soldering myself, I have now installed
TOS 1.04 German so I can use an ACSI Harddisk device.

No messing around on the PCB with adding 4 extra sockets.

And final upgrade, replace the VERY NOISY fan with a Noctua fan, as I found described on Youtube.

And although I told myself it would be the last machine I would be , expect a blog entry soon on an Amstrad CPC 6128 project, I swear it will be the last one.
