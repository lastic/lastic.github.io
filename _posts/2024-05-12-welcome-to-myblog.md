Glad to have you here. This blogsite will serve as a way 
for me (Lastic) to document things I found, experiences
I had , relive nostalgia and is primarely focused on 
Atari, demoscene, BBSes and general Geek stuff.



Since I'm relatively NEW to the Atari scene (2016) I still rediscover
things which are exciting or new to me which might be considered obsolete.

Sometimes I find a way to teach an old dog new tricks using more recent
hardware, sometimes I just delve into older stuff.

Coming from a programmer-degree in my studies but never having used those skills
, I am trying to embark on developing in Python, Assembler , C .

My UNIX background from my student days and my broad experience in computing 
systems (mainframe/midrange/pc's) has aided me a lot in my networking career.

I plan to visit quite a few Atari events/meetings this year and as such will
give my OWN perspective on them.

Since I am also running a real hardware Atari ST BulletinBoardSystem since
March 2024, a lot of work is also going into that and I will probably document
the broader process/progress on here as well.

Hope you enjoy my little corner here on the interwebz.
