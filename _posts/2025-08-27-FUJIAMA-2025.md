After coming back I have gotten sick after a week so still recovering
hence the late report.

This year the event started on Monday the 11th of August at midnight until Sunday the 17th of August.

Yes 7 days of retro-computing gathering.

Hosted by Helmut at the Schutzenhaus in Lengenfeld.

This year I was fortunate enough to share a car ride with Prodatron towards Lengenfeld which allowed me to take with me the most extensive
and heavy luggage I have ever taken to an event.    

Yep, thecell.ar BBS MegaSTe was going with me to be able to troubleshoot
it's hardware expansion with Manterola and to have its missing DIN13 connector reinstalled.   

On top of that my 1040STe and my Amstrad CPC6128 , yup keeping it AY/YM this year.   

For those loving my Tetris packing skills, here are some pictures :)

And so off we went on Sunday to Lengenfeld, arriving early so time
for a first [TSINGTAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingtao_Brewery) beer courtesy of Prodatron, the author of [SYMBOS](http://www.symbos.de/)

After a nice Italian dinner, we gathered at the Schutzenhaus while more
and more people started arriving, awaiting the official opening of the
doors at midnight.

And then the attendees would start setting up tables and moving their stuff inside.

Manterola waving, so glad he made it once again all the way from the USA, always a joy to meet-up face to face.

After a few chats and beers, time to go to bed and start this wonderfull
7 days of retro pleasure.

The program for Fujiama was supplied by Cas - the ABBUC president - 
and allows people to participate at their own leisure.

The agenda shifted around a bit partly due to the extreme hot weather but here are some highlights not in a particular order


- Boardgames like M.U.L.E or PACMAN

![MULE](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/MULE.JPG)

![PACMAN](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/PACMAN.JPG)

- Atari 8bit Nerd quiz
- BallBlazer competition
- Yazee using Fujinet between an Atari and Apple II

![FUJITZEE_APPLE](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/FUJITZEE_APPLE.JPG)

![FUJITZEE_XE](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/FUJITZEE_XE.JPG)

- Pong competition

![PONG](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/PONG.JPG)

- creating a game in 48 hours on Atari 8 bit
- creating a 1K assembler program in 24 hours
- ugBASIC programming tutorial

I'm guessing around Wednesday there were 50 people in attendance.

Both me and 505 were making our first steps into 68K Atari ST assembler
, after a very AHA hint of NO "You did switch to supervisor mode huh",
I finally had double-buffering working.

This is what Fujiama is all about, you can talk with people, work on projects together, share thoughts, a beer, stories, laughs , play games.   

One moment somebody helps you, the other moment you are able to help somebody else.   

During this week 

- had so many interesting talks sometimes a few life lessons also
- I learned a fair amount of basic 16-bit Assembler
- with thanks to Max and Stefan had my DIN13 video
  connector reinstalled into my MegaSTe
- gratefully received Manterola's DC-port after we
  concluded mine was borked

Shameless plug, my telnet BBS is now Multi-user as in there are now
2 modems attached so 2 users can be connected simultanously.

telnet thecell.ar port 1040

So by Friday,Saturday I think we had 80 people present.

![FRIDAY](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/FRIDAY.JPG)

Since so many pictures had been taken already by Mathy I decided just
to take a few things that stood out to me.

Both NO and Cas were using the [MNT Reform](https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform) laptops, a complete open-source design from start to finish.

![MNT_REFORM](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/MNT_REFORM.JPG)

505 brought his Atari STE and had a large collection of demos on floppies which he perused during Fujiama.

![505](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/505.JPG)

Some items from the ABBUC shop.

The soon to be released ATR-8000 clone aka Sally 2

![SALLY2](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/SALLY2.JPG)

Prodatron brought the ISETTA TTL computer and yes it can run Symbos

![ISETTA_TTL](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/ISETTA_TTL.JPG)

Beetle brought his 3D printer and Oscilloscope amongst many other things :)

![BEETLE](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/BEETLE.JPG)

![3D](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/3D.JPG)

![OSCILLOSCOPE](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/OSCILLOSCOPE.JPG)

As such we were able to watch this [Revision 2025 demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnBIhyF-eH8) on his oscilloscope at Fujiama, crazy to see it in real-time.

Yellowman brought a NEC PC-Engine, first I saw it in real life.

![PCENGINE](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/PCENGINE.JPG)

![PCENGINE_JOYSTICK](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/PCENGINE_JOYSTICK.JPG)

Norbert (Speccy) brought his Spectrum hardware, this year projecting 
his video output on a portable white-screen using a short-throw projector.

A really interesting idea if you don't want to carry around a huge monitor.

A lot of floppy archiving was done also, who said floppies are dead ?

![FLOPPIES](/assets/images/FUJIAMA2025/FLOPPIES.JPG)

Poison (CZ), who also attended Fujiama again this year brought his POKEY music CD collection, you can find more details [here](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/382996-physical-cds-with-poisons-music-on-fujiama-2025/)

Kaz and Pancio (Poland) also dropped by , I always enjoy the conversations.

As Kaz is convinced that I will be able to learn Polish, he provided
me with the new GREL magazine in order to aid me in learning to read
Polish.

As tradition dictates we had the Grill on Saturday and the group picture.

But all good things come to an end so Sunday arrived and after packing
and tidying up our stuff, saying goodbyes to those present , it was time to return home.

As always my batteries are completely recharged , the social interactions, the ability to speak German, all the nice hardware
and retro-nostalgic feelings.

Sadly after a week back home started getting sick but that cannot drain
the retro-energy which has been charged up again to 110%.

Here are some more reports which might include more pictures
