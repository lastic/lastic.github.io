I was asked by 505 if I wanted to contribute to atariscne.org by writing a report on my second visit to GEMTOS 2025.   
Which I gladly accepted, thanks again to 505 for reformatting my draft and putting it online on there.   
I had a fabulous time whilst in France, Saint-Juste-en-Chaussee once again meeting many familiar faces.
